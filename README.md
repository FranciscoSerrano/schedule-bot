# Schedule Generator for RTL's

Hello, my name is Francisco. I'm a genius at Apple R291. I noticed an opportinuty to make scheduling a little bit easier for you Retail Team Leads. So I wrote a little program that will take the HUGE spread sheet you get turn it into an interactive webpage so you can easily see your teams schedules.

It's far from perfect so any feedback is much appreciateed. Definitly consider this to be in Beta right now.

You can send me ideas or feedback on slack or email and can find me using fserrano@apple.com

## Installation Instructions

I wrote this program using python so there are a just a couple of steps you need to do before you can use it.

1. Install the latest version of python here: https://www.python.org (the current version is 3.8.x)

2. After you install python simply run these commands in terminal:

    pip install pandas
    pip install plotly

These are libraries I used to make the program easier to write.

3. That's it you should be ready to use Schedule Bot!

Simply navigate to the schedule bot folder in Terminal, make sure your latset version of "All Shifts-Table 1.csv" is in the same directory, and run python3 schedule_bot.py

Enjoy!
